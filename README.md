# Programming and Scripting - Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the weekly exercises (Week 2 through to week 8) of GMIT's Higher Diploma in Data Analytic's 'Programming and Scripting' module. It also contains one lab exercise from the module.

### How to Download this Repository
Click on the green 'Clone or download' button near the top right of this page, and then select 'Download ZIP'. You will then need to unzip the downloaded file. You can download 7-zip [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

### What is Needed to Run the Python Scripts
Python 3.7.4 was used to create the scripts in this repository (download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Any version of Python 3 can run the scripts. You can also download Python by downloading the Python distribution, Anaconda. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and you will find instructions on how to download and install Anaconda for Windows [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

### How to Run the Python Scripts
See the section 'How to Run Python Scripts Using the Command-Line' [here](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/).

### Note on Comments
As Programming and Scripting is an introductory module, all code was required to be heavily commented, and comments were supposed to include reference to any sources consulted while writing the code.

## Files in this Repository
* Week2-BMI.py  -  a program for calculating BMI.
* Week3-ReverseAndSkip.py  -  a program involving basic string manipulation.
* Week4-loops.py  -  a program involving basic usage of while and if/else loops.
* Week5-WeekDay.py  -  a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
* Week6-sqrt.py  -  a program to find the square root of a float with a custom function.
* Week7-readFile.py  -  a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
* Week8-plots.py  -  a program that displays multiple plots on the one set of axes.
* lab04.01-grade.py  -  a program to calculate a student's grade based on inputted percentage.

### Note for Assessor
The exercises are mostly trivial, and my previous experience with Python was sufficient for completing all of them except the Week 8 exercise. For that exercise the lecture videos provided clear guidance. Other than the references included in the comments of the files, I really didn't need to research how to go about solving the problems, and it would I think be not-a-little-bit absurd to pretend I did by including references to StackOverflow about how to go about doing such trivial things as, for example, using the input() function to receive input from the console. As evidence of my previous programming experience, see my 'Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 8 Programmer' badge here: [see evidence of prior programming experience here](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/416897ef-486c-40d2-8ba3-11e79bd59622). What's life without a bit of cheek, after all?
