This repository contains the weekly exercises (Week 2 through to week 8) for Programming and Scripting. It also contains one lab exercise.

As Programming and Scripting is an introductory module, all code was required to be heavily commented, and comments were supposed to include reference to any sources consulted while writing the code.

The exercises were trivial, and my previous experience with Python was sufficient for completing all of them except the Week 8 exercise. For that exercise the lecture videos of the course provided clear guidance. Other than the references included the comments of the files, I really didn't need to research how to go about solving the problems, and it would be not a little absurd to pretend I did by including references to StackOverflow about how to go about doing such trivial things as, for example, using the input() function to receive input from the console. As evidence of my previous programming experience, see my 'Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 8 Programmer' badge here: [see evidence of prior programming experience here](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/416897ef-486c-40d2-8ba3-11e79bd59622).

The repository contains the following python programs:
* Week2-BMI.py  -  a program for calculating BMI.
* Week3-ReverseAndSkip.py  -  a program involving basic string manipulation.
* Week4-loops.py  -  a program involving basic usage of while and if/else loops.
* Week5-WeekDay.py  -  a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
* Week6-sqrt.py  -  a program to find the square root of a float with a custom function.
* Week7-readFile.py  -  a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
* Week8-plots.py  -  a program that displays multiple plots on the one set of axes.
* lab04.01-grade.py  -  a program to calculate a student's grade based on inputted percentage.
