This repository contains the weekly exercises (Week 2 through to week 8) for Programming and Scripting. It also contains one lab exercise.

As Programming and Scripting is an introductory module, all code was required to be heavily commented, and comments were supposed to include reference to any sources consulted while writing the code.

The repository contains the following python programs:
* Week2-BMI.py  -  a program for calculating BMI.
* Week3-ReverseAndSkip.py  -  a program involving basic string manipulation.
* Week4-loops.py  -  a program involving basic usage of while and if/else loops.
* Week5-WeekDay.py  -  a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
* Week6-sqrt.py  -  a program to find the square root of a float with a custom function.
* Week7-readFile.py  -  a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
* Week8-plots.py  -  a program that displays multiple plots on the one set of axes.
